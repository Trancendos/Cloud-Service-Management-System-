## Important Notes

### ⚠️ These are PR Comments, Not Issues

**AI Code Review Reports should remain as PR comments and NOT be converted to issues.**

Reasons:
1. They are informational feedback for the PR author
2. They are tied to specific code changes in the PR
3. They are automatically resolved when the PR is merged/closed
4. Creating issues from them creates noise in the issue tracker
